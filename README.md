# 103cipher
###### Partner: **Ángel Daniel Sánchez García**
## Objectives:

* Transcript the key into numbers using the ASCII table.
* Convert the numbered key into a square matrix, the smallest possible size, and filling the lines first.
* Transcript the clear message into numbers using the ASCII table.
* Convert the numbered message into a matrix; its number of columns should fit the key matrix size.
and its number of lines should be as small as possible.
* Multiply the 2 matrices, and write the answer linearly to get the encrypted message.

## Usage:
You have to execute the following command:
```
> ./103cipher message key flag
```
* **message:** [string] message to encrypt/decrypt
* **key:** [string] encryption key
* **flag:** [0, 1] -> 0 to encrypt, 1 to decrypt
